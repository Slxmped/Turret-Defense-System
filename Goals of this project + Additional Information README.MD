Results (Testing and Troubleshooting): 
How is the finished project to be tested to determine that it works correctly? Use of sub-system unit test programs.

The finished project will be determined by using the sensor to rotate and detect any object in the vicinity. Once the object is detected either a projectile will be fired or the LEDs will indicate a projectile being fired. There can also be a combination of both a projectile being fired and the LEDs flashing. There will be three indications, one for reloading, one for ready, and one for firing. Once each of these have been met then the experiment works correctly. There may or may not be a camera added to the experiment for face tracking, that will be an optional component to this experiment. The servo most move in a sweep motion automatically and the sensor must detect what is in its radius to fire upon it. Depending on the build I may need to incorporate more servos for the firing mechanism or introduce springs to the system or maybe even a rubber band to be the system’s launcher. The system is working correctly when the LEDs function accordingly, the sensor and servo also work accordingly in their motions and detections and the launcher works perfectly in launching a projectile at the stopped distance.
  
Conclusion: 
What are the final deliverables? Working prototype demonstration, complete technical documentation, oral presentation to describe the project.
What can be concluded from this experiment is that it is very possible to create a defense system for your home through Arduino. The use of servos, ultrasonic sensors, rubber bands, LEDs, and more can create a defense system for your home. In the making of this experiment, the servo motor begins its sweep with the ultrasonic sensor activated and scanning the area. There’s a set distance on the ultrasonic sensor and the servo makes its 180 degree sweeps back and forth. The green LED represents that the system is ready to fire. Once an object is detected, the LED changes to a flashing red and the servos in the launching system release the rubber band while the launcher system faces the same direction as the servo and launches in that direction. The servo stops spinning as the launching mechanism fires and then resumes its spinning state once the object is struck. In theory, this can be used to defend a person’s home once under attack once this technology has been perfected and tested for facial recognition for identification purposes.
Microcontroller: The micro controller is a board that has 54 digital input/output pins. The board has 4 UARTS which are known as hardware serial ports. There are more characteristics to the board such as the 54 digital input/output pins. These pins can be configured as PWM outputs for certain components. There are 16 analog inputs and the board comes with a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, an ICSP header, power jack, and reset button. What will be used in this project from the microcontroller are the analog/digital input and output pins, the hardware serial ports, the PWM capabilities of the microcontroller, and the USB connection. The pins will be used to connect the servo motor to the Arduino board for servo access control. This will be connected using the analog pins on the Arduino board. The ultrasonic sensor will be connected using the digital pins on the microcontroller for distance detection control, and the gun turret will be connected to either the digital or analog pins depending on my choosing. The USB connection will be used to connect the microcontroller to the computer to enable the program to run on the microcontroller.
Components: In the design of the project, there are a few components that will be used as Advanced Input Sensors, Advanced Output Devices, Analog Output Devices, and Digital Output Devices. The first (Advanced Input Sensor) that will be used is the ultra-sonic sensor. The ultrasonic sensor is a device that will measure distance by using ultrasonic waves using a sensor and a receiver. The sensor emits ultrasonic waves and receives waves reflected back from the target in vicinity. This is done using a distance calculation of L = ½ * T * C. The transducer of the sensor receives and sends the ultrasonic sound which determines the distance through time lapses. The ultrasonic sensor will use this logic to detect certain objects in the range that is given to the ultrasonic sensors. The sensors can be programmed to detect a specific range as opposed to any type of range. Once an object becomes visible within that range, the sensor will send a signal and receive the sent signal detecting said object. 
The next component that will be used is a servo which will act as the (Advanced Output Device). The servo is a device that incorporates a two wire DC motor, Gear train, potentiometer and an IC with an output shaft. A signal sent by code will turn the servo to different positions based on the type of information sent. The servo’s shaft will move clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the information given to the servo motor. In the project, the goal of the Servo motor is to sweep the area with the ultrasonic sensor attached to the servo motor. The servo can move from 0-180 degrees to sweep the area around it. Another component that will bring this project together are LEDs which will act as the (Digital Output Device) in this project. A Light Emitting Diode (LED) is a semiconductor device which converts electricity into light. Each diode is about ¼ inch in diameter and needs 10 milliamps to perform about a tenth of a watt. LEDs require a driver which acts as an analog to its ballast. Drivers for the LED are bult into the fixture. The LEDs require plug-in transformers to allow the fixture to run on 120-volt AC. LEDs are better at placing light in a single direction than incandescent or fluorescent bulbs. The Purpose of the LEDs in this project is to act as indicators to what the turret is currently doing. Once the turret is in a state of being ready to fire, the LED will appear as green. When the turret is in the state of firing, the LED will blink red, when the turret is in the state of reloading, the LED will turn to yellow. The purpose of the LEDs is simply for communication to the user on what the turret is specifically performing.
A component that will function as an output device to this project is the cartridge that will hold the ammunition for the turret. The cartridge is considered an output device because this will be responsible for launching out the projectile once a target is detected within the vicinity. The important components to note in the cartridge system is that there is a spring inside of each magazine clip. The spring will load the dart into place using pressurization of the spring. With each dart that gets released, another will be loaded into place for the next shot to form. The way this helps the project is that this will function as the ammunition that the turret needs to shoot. With each load the turret will shoot based on the mechanism of the nerf gun and the ammo cartridge. The way this system will be joined is in conjunction with a solenoid and relay. A solenoid is an electromechanical device that uses an electric current, coil of wire, and has its own movable core. The core is responsible for moving as it responds to the magnetic field
The type of data communication interface and protocol that will be used in the original project idea will be high level data communication. The connection between the microcontroller and the software will use a USB cable. High level data communication consists of USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The USB will connect to activate the board and be used to upload data from the program to the board. This will transfer a certain amount of data to the board and give communication to features in the program such as the serial monitor and serial plotter based on the chosen board. Arduino boards will communicate with computers using UART protocol which provides methods of reading and writing data. Arduinos typically have one serial port for hardware but mega has four. Serial communication is important for establishing a connection between software and hardware and this will ensure that the project runs smoothly and the output results can be measured.
Real Life Application & Comparison: There are many real-world applications of this project. The real-world applications of this project are similar to missile launchers or turret systems. In reality, this system will function as a defense system for a citizen’s home. If an intruder invades on a person’s home, the turret can be upgraded into a more lethal way of home defense that will stop intruders in their tracks using facial recognition technology or it can potentially be remote piloted with voice access or even voice commands for people entering the home to enable the turret in safe mode so no one gets hurt. If someone intrudes on your home, the police will not come intime before something is done about the certain intruder and it may be too late. With this defense system, you can confront the intruder without putting yourself in harm’s way to get them out of your homes. Lethal could be the form of stun guns, bbs, paintballs, or rubber bullets in case the user doesn’t want the intruder to be completely neutralized. Overall, the goal behind this project is so that citizens can realize that they can have advanced defense systems in their home and don’t have to depend on any type of higher up or authority for defense.
In Comparison with previous projects, there are components in other designers’ products that differ from the system in my creation. In previous designer’s projects, they either have a remote-controlled automated turret of some type or a turret that has software-based motion sensor tracking. Their turrets also have a separated launcher that doesn’t move with the ultrasonic sensor and fires on its own at a certain target. In my project, the turret will be fit onto the ultrasonic sensor and servo and the system will move as one unit. The servo should be strong enough to carry the turret as the nerf gun will be stripped away for its useful parts and the important components will be kept. The difference in the mechanical portion of the design is that the trigger on my turret will be activated by DC motors that will pull onto a thread of some sort maybe a zip tie or something in similar design and it will pull the trigger and allow the turret to shoot. Certain turrets made by different designers will use two DC motors to make the bullet travel based on the turret aligning the bullet in place to the DC motors rotation. Once the bullet touches the rotators, the bullet flies out of the turret into the direction it stops in. My turret will not use any tracking and will generally fire where a pulse is sensed from the ultrasonic sensor.
