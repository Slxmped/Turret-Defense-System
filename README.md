Turret Defense System Project: 
# Abstract/Summary
Turret Defense System is built for protection
(In the Arduino project that will be designed, I will be creating an automated turret system using components in the Arduino kit and other out sourced components. This is important because U.S citizens need to know that they can make basic home defense systems inside of their home and not only the government should know the technological makings behind certain systems. The problem that this will solve is the defense of homes in the U.S. If done correctly, U.S citizens who feel like their home is threatened from breaking and entering can have defense systems in place to neutralize any threat that intrudes to cause bodily harm to anyone inside of their homes. This will be useful in the defense and protection of families just in case the cops cannot show up in time as per usual. It isn’t useful for the police to show up when the victim is already harmed and incapacitated so it’s better to have an aid to help you defend you and your loved ones).
