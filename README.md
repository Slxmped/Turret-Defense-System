# Abstract/Summary
Turret Defense System is built for protection
(In the Arduino project that will be designed, I will be creating an automated turret system using components in the Arduino kit and other out sourced components. This is important because U.S citizens need to know that they can make basic home defense systems inside of their home and not only the government should know the technological makings behind certain systems. The problem that this will solve is the defense of homes in the U.S. If done correctly, U.S citizens who feel like their home is threatened from breaking and entering can have defense systems in place to neutralize any threat that intrudes to cause bodily harm to anyone inside of their homes. This will be useful in the defense and protection of families just in case the cops cannot show up in time as per usual. It isn’t useful for the police to show up when the victim is already harmed and incapacitated so it’s better to have an aid to help you defend you and your loved ones).

# Literature Review(Background Information)
The project for the missile defense system has been done before and people have tried to solve a similar problem. Users have used the ultrasonic sensor, Processing, and missile launchers that they have found in order to create the automated turret system. Some people have created a firing system or have found a firing system online. The best hope is to find a firing system online but if not, I may have to figure out how to build one from scratch and use it as the firing mechanism. People have solved their problem in terms of finding the correct components to create the system. People online have used nerf darts, already constructed projectile systems, or home-made devices that were assembled to launch a projectile. The devices in their projects were either separated from the ultrasonic sensor or attached in combination with the sensor and servo. I have to solve my own problem of obtaining the correct components to create a projectile launcher. In short, the servo sweeps the area with the ultra-sonic sensor, the sensor detects and object in range, and the device used to launch a projectile to a target launches the projectile at the specified target.
