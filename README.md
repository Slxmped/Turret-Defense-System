# Abstract/Summary
Turret Defense System is built for protection
(In the Arduino project that will be designed, I will be creating an automated turret system using components in the Arduino kit and other out sourced components. This is important because U.S citizens need to know that they can make basic home defense systems inside of their home and not only the government should know the technological makings behind certain systems. The problem that this will solve is the defense of homes in the U.S. If done correctly, U.S citizens who feel like their home is threatened from breaking and entering can have defense systems in place to neutralize any threat that intrudes to cause bodily harm to anyone inside of their homes. This will be useful in the defense and protection of families just in case the cops cannot show up in time as per usual. It isn’t useful for the police to show up when the victim is already harmed and incapacitated so it’s better to have an aid to help you defend you and your loved ones).

# Literature Review(Background Information)
The project for the missile defense system has been done before and people have tried to solve a similar problem. Users have used the ultrasonic sensor, Processing, and missile launchers that they have found in order to create the automated turret system. Some people have created a firing system or have found a firing system online. The best hope is to find a firing system online but if not, I may have to figure out how to build one from scratch and use it as the firing mechanism. People have solved their problem in terms of finding the correct components to create the system. People online have used nerf darts, already constructed projectile systems, or home-made devices that were assembled to launch a projectile. The devices in their projects were either separated from the ultrasonic sensor or attached in combination with the sensor and servo. I have to solve my own problem of obtaining the correct components to create a projectile launcher. In short, the servo sweeps the area with the ultra-sonic sensor, the sensor detects and object in range, and the device used to launch a projectile to a target launches the projectile at the specified target.

# Methodology
The way these software tools will be used in combination of this project is that Arduino IDE 2 will be used to create a program that will have control of a servo (Output Devices – Advanced), ultrasonic sensor (Input Sensors - Advanced), LEDs (Output Devices – Digital), aa solenoid (Output Devices - Digital) and a singular relay module. The ultrasonic sensor will be used to detect targets coming in to a certain location. When a target is detected and the automated turret system is ready to fire, this will be indicated with a projectile being launched from the turret and the flashing red LEDs indicating that the turret is firing. The Servo will be attached to a stabilized structure that will hold the housing of the turret. The ultrasonic sensor is then mounted to the servo using the housing of the turret’s head. The gun will mount the servo inside the turret’s housing head. Once a target is detected, the LEDs will indicate whether the system is shooting or in a ready state to shoot. Red flashing LED means the system is firing, and green means the system is ready to fire again. The ammo cartridge or the system I will be using will load the ammo and shoot again until the target is out of the vicinity and resume its sweep motion until another target is found. The servo will rotate the ultrasonic sensor automatically, A certain distance will be set for the sensor so every distance isn’t being shot at, and the LED’s will stay at a certain state to indicate the action. 
	In designing the system, many components will be connected in a format that allows communication between the systems. In the design, there will be an ultrasonic sensor. There is a wire connected from pin A0 on the Arduino to the trig of the ultrasonic sensor. The echo for the ultrasonic sensor is connected to the A1 pin on the Arduino board establishing the input and output connections of the sensor. The sensor is then connected to 5V of power from the Arduino board and grounded with the Arduino board. The ultrasonic sensor is placed in the housing of the turret's head to search for distances. Two LEDs were also connected to the Arduino board which will act as indicators of cycles between the different states. The green LEDs cathode was connected to the ground of the Arduino and the anode is connected to pin 12 on the Arduino. The cathode for the red LED is connected to the ground of the Arduino and the anode is connected to pin 13 on the Arduino board. A servo is also included into the project and in the servo connection, the ground and power make a connection to the power and ground of the Arduino board. The servo will be responsible for rotating the turret's head and allowing the ultrasonic sensor to scan the area. The pin for servo control is attached to pin 11 on the Arduino board for functionality. The final components that will be connected to the Arduino board is the solenoid that will be responsible for pulling the trigger of the turret and the relay that will be responsible for controlling the solenoid and adapting it to the 5V voltage given to the board. This will allow the turret to fire once a certain condition has been met. A 12V adapter will connect power to one of the relays ON pins and the power connection from the solenoid will be connected to one of the relays ON pins. The 12V adapter will be grounded using the ground of the solenoid. The relay voltage and ground are set to the Arduino’s voltage and ground connections on the breadboard. The control pin from the relay is set to the Arduino’s pin 10 for solenoid control. The servo sits at the base of the box at the top to hold the turrets head and the solenoid sits at the back end of the turrets head with a string around the trigger ready to pull at will. The relay is placed inside of the base of the box near the breadboard and Arduino board.
